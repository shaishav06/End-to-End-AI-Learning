## 2️⃣ AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
### 🏛 2.1 Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI is the overarching concept that involves creating machines capable of intelligent behavior. It encompasses all approaches that enable computers to perform human-like cognitive tasks.

### 📊 2.2 Machine Learning (ML)
Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming. It includes:
- ✅ **Supervised Learning**: Learning from labeled data.
- 🔍 **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data.
- 🎮 **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error with rewards.

### 🧠 2.3 Deep Learning (DL)
Deep Learning is a further subset of ML that uses multi-layered neural networks to model complex patterns in large datasets. It powers advancements in **image recognition**, **speech processing**, and **autonomous systems**.
