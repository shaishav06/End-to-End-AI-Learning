## 🧠 1. Introduction to AI
### 📌 Definition and Scope
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include speech recognition, decision-making, and problem-solving.

### 🤔 AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
- **AI**: Broad field encompassing all intelligent machine behavior.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data.
- **Deep Learning**: A further subset of ML using neural networks to learn patterns.

### 🌍 Real-World Applications
