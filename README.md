## 1. Introduction to AI
### Definition and Scope
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include speech recognition, decision-making, and problem-solving.

### AI vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
- **AI**: Broad field encompassing all intelligent machine behavior.
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data.
- **Deep Learning**: A further subset of ML using neural networks to learn patterns.

### Real-World Applications
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Natural Language Processing (Chatbots, Translation)
- Medical Diagnosis
- Fraud Detection
